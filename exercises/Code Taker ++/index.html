        <h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
        <h4>BY ROBERT FROST</h4>
        <p>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
        And sorry I <span class="secret">c</span>ould not travel both<br />
        And be one traveler, long I st<span class="secret">o</span>od<br />
        And looke<span class="secret">d</span> down one as far as I could<br />
        To where <span class="secret">i</span>t be<span class="secret">n</span>t in the under<span class="secret">g</span>rowth;<br />
        </p>
        <p>
        Then<span class="secret"> </span>took the other, as just as fair,<br />
        And hav<span class="secret">i</span>ng perhaps the better claim,<br />
        Because it was gras<span class="secret">s</span>y and wanted<span class="secret"> </span>wear;<br />
        Though as for th<span class="secret">a</span>t the passing there<br />
        Had <span class="secret">w</span>orn them really about the same,<br />
        </p>
        <p>
        And both that morning <span class="secret">e</span>qually lay<br />
        In leave<span class="secret">s</span> no step had trodden black.<br />
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
        Yet knowing how way leads <span class="secret">o</span>n to way,<br />
        I doubted if I should ever come back.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
        I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
        So<span class="secret">m</span>ewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br />
        I took the one less trav<span class="secret">e</span>led by,<br />
        And that has made all the difference.<br />
