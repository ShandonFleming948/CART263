# I SPY
## Shandon Fleming

This is a fun twist on the classic game of I SPY. Instead of playing the game with another person, the user/player plays the game with the computer. Using responsiveVoice, the computer gives the player the I SPY clues and the player has to connect the clue to one of the many images on the screen by clicking on it before the timer runs out. To add to the interactivity of the game, the clues that the computer gives are riddles instead of simply colors, and the computer has a clear (and wacky) personality.
